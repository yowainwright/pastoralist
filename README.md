A tool to watch over node module **`*overrides and resolutions`** 🐑 👩🏽‍🌾

> \***overrides and resolutions**
>
> Overrides and resolutions solve the same problem-they give developers a way to specify the dependency versions downloaded to repository's `node_modules`. This is very convenient for setting dependency dependencies to specific versions to fix security issues. However, it is easy to lose track of why an override or resolution is specified. This is an inconvenient problem when trying to maintain useable dependencies over time—until now.

---
## Synopsis

By running **Pastoralist** in a `pre-commit` hook (or other command) an override/resolution which looks like this:

```js
// package.json
"overrides": {
  "trim": "^0.0.3"
},
```

Will look like this:

```js
// package.json
"overrides": {
  "trim": "^0.0.3"
},
"pastoralist": {
  "appendix": {
    "trim@^0.0.3": {
      "remark-parse": "4.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

By running this!

```sh
pastoralist
# oh hech yeah!
```

But there's more!

If **Pastoralist** is run and a `resolution` or `override` is no longer required
it will clean up itself and resolutions!

```js
// pastoralist finds and removes `trim` when/if it's no longer needed!
"overrides": {},
"pastoralist": {
  "appendix": {}
}
```

## How Pastoralist works

**Pastoralist** manages `overrides` and `resolutions` so you don't have to!

**Pastoralist** is comprised of a few functions which read **node_modules** `package.json` files and reduce overrides or resolutions within the root `package.json` into a single `pastoralist.appendix` object.

- **Pastoralist** adds an `pastoralist.appendix` with a list of "resolved" dependencies.
- Better yet, if Pastoralist observes an `override` or `resolution` is no longer needed, it removes it from `resolutions`, `overrides`, and the pastoralist `appendix` object.
- This means with **Pastoralist**, your **only** concern is adding dependencies to the `overrides` and `resolutions` objects.

### Key notes

- **Pastoralist** does **not** manage what is added to overrides and resolutions objects.
- **Pastoralist does** manage dependenceis that exists in a `package.json`'s overrides or resolutions objects.
  - **Pastoralist** will remove overrides and resolutions if they become unneeded according to child `package.json`'s spec!

## Install

```sh
npm install pastoralist --save-dev
# pastoralist does not expect to be a dependency! It's a tool!!!
```

---

## Usage

**Pastoralist** is built to be used as a CLI program and runs with a single word "pastoralist".`

```sh
pastoralist
# => That's it! Chack out your package json
```

**Pastoralist** can _and should be incorporated_ into your workflow—which ever way is best for you and your team's developer experience! 👌

## Roadmap

**Updated `2022-05-20`**

- More tests (in progress)
- Local development setup (next few days)
