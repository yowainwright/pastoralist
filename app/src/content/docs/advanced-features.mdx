Pastoralist includes several advanced features that make dependency override management more powerful and maintainable.

## Patch Support

Pastoralist automatically detects and tracks patches created by tools like `patch-package`.

### How It Works

When you have patches in your `patches/` directory:

```
patches/
├── lodash+4.17.21.patch
├── express+4.18.0.patch
└── react+18.2.0.patch
```

Pastoralist will track them in the appendix:

```json
{
  "pastoralist": {
    "appendix": {
      "lodash@4.17.21": {
        "dependents": {
          "my-app": "lodash@^4.17.0"
        },
        "patches": ["patches/lodash+4.17.21.patch"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Benefits

- **Visibility**: See which overrides have patches applied
- **Cleanup Detection**: Get notified about unused patches
- **Documentation**: Understand why patches exist alongside overrides

### Unused Patch Detection

When a dependency is removed, pastoralist alerts you:

```
🐑 Found 2 potentially unused patch files:
  - patches/old-package+1.0.0.patch
  - patches/removed-dep+2.0.0.patch
Consider removing these patches if the packages are no longer used.
```

## PeerDependencies Support

Pastoralist now considers `peerDependencies` when tracking override usage.

### Example

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "react": "18.2.0"
  }
}
```

The appendix will reflect peer dependency requirements:

```json
{
  "pastoralist": {
    "appendix": {
      "react@18.2.0": {
        "dependents": {
          "my-component": "react@^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Smart Cleanup

Pastoralist intelligently removes overrides that are no longer needed.

### Automatic Removal

When a dependency is updated and no longer needs an override:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.0"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "lodash": "4.17.21"
  }
}
```

**After updating lodash to 4.17.21:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  },
  "overrides": {}
}
```

### Transitive Dependency Tracking

Pastoralist tracks overrides needed by transitive dependencies:

```json
{
  "pastoralist": {
    "appendix": {
      "minimist@1.2.8": {
        "dependents": {
          "mkdirp": "minimist@^1.2.6",
          "optimist": "minimist@~1.2.0"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Fuzzy Version Matching

Pastoralist intelligently matches version ranges to determine if overrides are needed.

### How It Works

Given these dependencies:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0"
  }
}
```

And this override:
```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "express": "4.18.2"
  }
}
```

Pastoralist understands that `^4.18.0` could resolve to `4.18.2` naturally, so the override might not be necessary unless it's fixing a specific issue.

## Appendix Preservation

The appendix is preserved even when overrides are temporarily removed, maintaining historical context.

### Example Scenario

1. **Initial state**: Override with appendix
2. **Dependency removed**: Override removed, appendix preserved
3. **Dependency re-added**: Override can be restored with context

This helps teams understand the history of override decisions.

## Multi-Format Support

While pastoralist uses npm's `overrides` format, it understands conversions from:

- **Yarn 1.x**: `resolutions`
- **pnpm**: `pnpm.overrides`
- **Yarn Berry**: `resolutions` with different syntax

### Conversion Example

From Yarn:
```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "package-a": "1.0.0",
    "**/package-b": "2.0.0"
  }
}
```

To npm (what pastoralist uses):
```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "package-a": "1.0.0",
    "package-b": "2.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching

Pastoralist caches dependency trees during execution to avoid repeated file system reads.

### Parallel Processing

When using `--depPaths`, multiple package.json files are processed efficiently.

### Minimal File Writes

Package.json is only rewritten if changes are detected, preserving timestamps and reducing unnecessary git changes.

## Debug Mode Insights

Debug mode (`--debug`) provides detailed information:

```
🐑 pastoralist checking herd...
[DEBUG] Reading package.json from /path/to/package.json
[DEBUG] Found 3 overrides
[DEBUG] Analyzing dependency tree...
[DEBUG] lodash@4.17.21 required by:
  - express@4.18.0 (wants lodash@^4.17.0)
  - custom-utils@1.0.0 (wants lodash@~4.17.0)
[DEBUG] Writing updated package.json
✅ pastoralist the herd is safe!
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### patch-package

Pastoralist complements `patch-package` by tracking which overrides have associated patches:

```bash
# Apply a patch
npx patch-package lodash

# Run pastoralist to update tracking
npx pastoralist
```

### npm-check-updates

Use with `npm-check-updates` to manage both regular updates and overrides:

```bash
# Update dependencies
npx npm-check-updates -u

# Update override tracking
npx pastoralist
```

### Renovate/Dependabot

Configure automated tools to run pastoralist after updates:

```json
{
  "postUpgradeTasks": {
    "commands": ["npm install", "npx pastoralist"],
    "fileFilters": ["package.json"]
  }
}
```

## Custom Workflows

### Override Policies

Create policies for when overrides should be used:

```javascript
// scripts/check-override-policy.js
const pkg = require('./package.json');

const policies = {
  security: ['minimist', 'lodash'],  // Always override for security
  compatibility: ['react'],           // Override for compatibility
  temporary: ['experimental-pkg']     // Temporary overrides
};

// Validate overrides match policies
Object.keys(pkg.overrides || {}).forEach(override => {
  const category = Object.entries(policies)
    .find(([_, pkgs]) => pkgs.includes(override))?.[0];
    
  if (!category) {
    console.warn(`Override '${override}' has no policy!`);
  }
});
```

### Appendix Analysis

Extract insights from the appendix:

```javascript
const pkg = require('./package.json');
const appendix = pkg.pastoralist?.appendix || {};

// Find overrides with most dependents
const overrideImpact = Object.entries(appendix)
  .map(([override, info]) => ({
    override,
    dependentCount: Object.keys(info.dependents || {}).length
  }))
  .sort((a, b) => b.dependentCount - a.dependentCount);

console.log('Highest impact overrides:', overrideImpact.slice(0, 5));
```

## Future-Proofing

Pastoralist is designed to adapt as package managers evolve:

- **Version compatibility**: Handles different package.json formats
- **Extensible appendix**: Room for additional metadata
- **Backward compatibility**: Older versions can read newer appendixes

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Run pastoralist regularly, ideally in postinstall
2. **Review Patches**: Periodically review patches for upstream fixes
3. **Document Policies**: Create clear policies for override usage
4. **Monitor Impact**: Track which overrides affect the most packages
5. **Clean Regularly**: Remove overrides as soon as they're not needed
