## The Problem

When using npm overrides or yarn resolutions, you often:
- Forget why an override was added
- Leave outdated overrides in place
- Don't know which packages need them

## The Solution

Pastoralist automatically:
- Documents each override with an appendix
- Shows which packages require each override
- Removes unnecessary overrides
- Runs via postinstall hooks

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a test project
mkdir test-pastoralist && cd test-pastoralist

# Create package.json with overrides
echo '{
  "name": "test",
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "lodash": "4.17.20"
  }
}' > package.json

# Install and run pastoralist
npm install
npm install --save-dev pastoralist
npx pastoralist

# See the result - an appendix was added!
cat package.json
```

## How It Works

### Before Pastoralist

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21",
    "express": "^4.18.0"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "lodash": "4.17.20"  // Why is this here?
  }
}
```

### After Pastoralist

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "lodash": "4.17.20"
  },
  "pastoralist": {
    "appendix": {
      "lodash@4.17.20": {
        "dependents": {
          "express": "^4.18.0"  // Now we know!
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Automatic Cleanup

When dependencies no longer need an override, pastoralist removes it automatically:

```bash
üêë Removed 1 unnecessary override:
  - lodash@4.17.20
```

## Setup

### Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev pastoralist
```

### Add to postinstall

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "pastoralist"
  }
}
```

### For Monorepos

```bash
# Root package
pastoralist

# Specific workspace
pastoralist --path packages/app/package.json
```

## Common Use Cases

### Security Patches

```json
"overrides": {
  "minimist": "1.2.6"  // Security fix
}
```

Pastoralist tracks when the fix is incorporated upstream and removes the override.

### Version Conflicts

```json
"overrides": {
  "react": "17.0.2"  // Some packages need React 17
}
```

The appendix shows which packages aren't ready for React 18.

### API Usage

```javascript
import { runPastoralist } from 'pastoralist';

await runPastoralist({
  path: './package.json',
  silent: false
});
```
