## What is Pastoralist?

Pastoralist is a command-line tool that automatically manages and updates your package.json overrides, resolutions, and patches. It ensures that your dependency overrides stay up-to-date with the latest versions, saving you time and reducing potential security vulnerabilities.

## Why is Pastoralist Awesome?

### The Problem

When working with Node.js projects, you often need to override specific package versions due to:
- Security vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies
- Bug fixes that haven't been merged upstream
- Breaking changes you need to avoid
- Custom patches for specific use cases

However, managing these overrides manually is tedious and error-prone:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "lodash": "4.17.19",
    "minimist": "1.2.5",
    "node-fetch": "2.6.7"
  }
}
```

Over time, these overrides become outdated, and you might miss important security updates or bug fixes.

### The Solution

Pastoralist automates this process by:
- Scanning your package.json for overrides, resolutions, and patches
- Checking for newer versions of overridden packages
- Updating them automatically while maintaining compatibility
- Removing overrides that are no longer needed

With one simple command, you can ensure all your overrides are current:

```bash
pastoralist
```
