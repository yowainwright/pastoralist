Pastoralist includes an experimental security feature that can detect vulnerabilities in your dependencies and automatically generate package overrides to fix them.

## Overview

The security feature scans your project's dependencies against vulnerability databases and suggests or applies fixes through package overrides. This helps maintain secure dependencies without manual intervention.

## Quick Start

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Basic Check">
    ```bash
    # Check for vulnerabilities and display a report
    pastoralist --checkSecurity
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Auto Fix">
    ```bash
    # Automatically apply security fixes
    pastoralist --checkSecurity --forceSecurityRefactor
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Interactive">
    ```bash
    # Choose which fixes to apply
    pastoralist --checkSecurity --interactive
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Workspaces">
    ```bash
    # Include workspace packages in the scan
    pastoralist --checkSecurity --includeWorkspaces
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

You can configure security settings in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "pastoralist": {
    "security": {
      "enabled": false,
      "provider": "osv",
      "autoFix": false,
      "interactive": false,
      "securityProviderToken": "",
      "includeWorkspaces": false,
      "severityThreshold": "medium",
      "excludePackages": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable automatic security checks when running pastoralist |
| `provider` | string | `"osv"` | Security provider to use (currently only "osv" is implemented) |
| `autoFix` | boolean | `false` | Automatically apply security fixes without prompting |
| `interactive` | boolean | `false` | Use interactive mode to select which fixes to apply |
| `securityProviderToken` | string | `""` | Authentication token for providers that require it (future use) |
| `includeWorkspaces` | boolean | `false` | Include workspace packages in security scan |
| `severityThreshold` | string | `"medium"` | Minimum severity level to report (low, medium, high, critical) |
| `excludePackages` | array | `[]` | List of package names to exclude from security checks |

## CLI Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--checkSecurity` | Enable security vulnerability checking |
| `--forceSecurityRefactor` | Automatically apply security fixes without prompting |
| `--securityProvider <provider>` | Specify the security provider (default: "osv") |
| `--securityProviderToken <token>` | Provide authentication token for the security provider |
| `--interactive` | Use interactive mode to select fixes |
| `--includeWorkspaces` | Include workspace packages in the security scan |

## Security Providers

### OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities)

Currently, Pastoralist uses the [OSV database](https://osv.dev/) as its security provider. OSV is a distributed vulnerability database for open source, created by Google and the open source community.

<Card title="Benefits of OSV" icon="shield">
  - Fully open source and transparent
  - No authentication required
  - Aggregates data from multiple vulnerability sources
  - Fast and reliable API
  - Comprehensive coverage of npm packages
</Card>

### Planned Providers

Support for additional providers is planned for future releases:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="GitHub" icon="github">
    Dependabot alerts API
  </Card>
  <Card title="Snyk" icon="warning">
    Commercial vulnerability database
  </Card>
  <Card title="NPM" icon="npm">
    Native npm audit data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Socket" icon="puzzle">
    Supply chain security analysis
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How It Works

1. **Scanning**: Pastoralist extracts all dependencies from your `package.json` (and optionally workspace packages)
2. **Checking**: Dependencies are checked against the OSV database for known vulnerabilities
3. **Reporting**: Vulnerable packages are displayed with severity levels and available fixes
4. **Fixing**: If fixes are available, Pastoralist can:
   - Display them for review
   - Apply them automatically (with `--forceSecurityRefactor`)
   - Let you choose interactively (with `--interactive`)
5. **Applying**: Selected fixes are added to your `package.json` overrides section

## Example Output

```

   CVE: CVE-2021-44906
   ✅ Fix available: 1.2.6

📝 Generated 2 override(s):

  "lodash": "4.17.21" // Security fix: Prototype Pollution (high)
  "minimist": "1.2.6" // Security fix: Prototype Pollution (medium)
```

## Performance Considerations

:::caution[Performance Impact]
- Security scanning is **disabled by default** to maintain fast performance
- Workspace scanning is **opt-in** via the `includeWorkspaces` option
- The OSV provider is optimized for batch queries
- Results are processed in parallel when possible
:::

## Best Practices

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Regular Scanning" icon="rocket">
    Run security checks as part of your CI/CD pipeline
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review First" icon="document">
    Always review suggested fixes before applying them
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test After Fixes" icon="seti:test-js">
    Ensure your application still works after applying security overrides
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor Workspaces" icon="folder">
    In monorepos, consider enabling workspace scanning for comprehensive coverage
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Limitations

:::note[Current Limitations]
- Currently only supports npm packages
- Only the OSV provider is implemented
- Interactive mode requires the `inquirer` package (installed on demand)
- Some vulnerabilities may not have available fixes
:::

## Troubleshooting

### No vulnerabilities found when expected
- Ensure you're using the latest version of pastoralist
- Check that your dependencies are correctly specified in package.json
- Try running with `--debug` to see detailed logs

### Fixes not being applied
- Verify you have write permissions to package.json
- Check for existing overrides that might conflict
- Ensure the package manager supports overrides

### Performance issues
- Disable workspace scanning if not needed
- Consider excluding large dependency trees with `excludePackages`
- Use severity threshold to limit results

## Example: CI/CD Integration

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="GitHub Actions">
    ```yaml
    name: Security Check
    on: [push, pull_request]
    
    jobs:
      security:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
          - run: npm install
          - run: npx pastoralist --checkSecurity
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="GitLab CI">
    ```yaml
    security:
      script:
        - npm install
        - npx pastoralist --checkSecurity
      only:
        - main
        - merge_requests
    ```
  </TabItem>
