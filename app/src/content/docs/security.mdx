title: Security Vulnerability Detection
description: Detect and fix security vulnerabilities in your dependencies
---

Pastoralist includes an experimental security feature that can detect vulnerabilities in your dependencies and automatically generate package overrides to fix them.

## Overview

The security feature scans your project's dependencies against vulnerability databases and suggests or applies fixes through package overrides. This helps maintain secure dependencies without manual intervention.

## Quick Start

### Basic Check
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities and display a report
pastoralist --checkSecurity
```

### Auto Fix
```bash
# Automatically apply security fixes
pastoralist --checkSecurity --forceSecurityRefactor
```

### Interactive
```bash
# Choose which fixes to apply
pastoralist --checkSecurity --interactive
```

### Workspaces
```bash
# Include workspace packages in the scan
pastoralist --checkSecurity --includeWorkspaces
```

## Configuration

You can configure security settings in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "pastoralist": {
    "security": {
      "enabled": false,
      "provider": "osv",
      "autoFix": false,
      "interactive": false,
      "securityProviderToken": "",
      "includeWorkspaces": false,
      "severityThreshold": "medium",
      "excludePackages": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable automatic security checks when running pastoralist |
| `provider` | string | `"osv"` | Security provider to use ("osv" or "github") |
| `autoFix` | boolean | `false` | Automatically apply security fixes without prompting |
| `interactive` | boolean | `false` | Use interactive mode to select which fixes to apply |
| `securityProviderToken` | string | `""` | Authentication token for providers that require it |
| `includeWorkspaces` | boolean | `false` | Include workspace packages in security scan |
| `severityThreshold` | string | `"medium"` | Minimum severity level to report (low, medium, high, critical) |
| `excludePackages` | array | `[]` | List of package names to exclude from security checks |

## CLI Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--checkSecurity` | Enable security vulnerability checking |
| `--forceSecurityRefactor` | Automatically apply security fixes without prompting |
| `--securityProvider <provider>` | Specify the security provider (default: "osv") |
| `--securityProviderToken <token>` | Provide authentication token for the security provider |
| `--interactive` | Use interactive mode to select fixes |
| `--includeWorkspaces` | Include workspace packages in the security scan |

## Security Providers

### OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities)

Currently, Pastoralist uses the [OSV database](https://osv.dev/) as its security provider. OSV is a distributed vulnerability database for open source, created by Google and the open source community.

#### Benefits of OSV

- Fully open source and transparent
- No authentication required
- Aggregates data from multiple vulnerability sources
- Fast and reliable API
- Comprehensive coverage of npm packages

### GitHub Provider

The GitHub provider uses Dependabot alerts to check for vulnerabilities. This provider queries GitHub's Dependabot API for your repository.

#### Setup

The GitHub provider supports two authentication methods:

**Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)**

If you have the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated, no additional setup is required:

```bash
# Install and authenticate gh CLI
gh auth login

# Run pastoralist with GitHub provider
pastoralist --checkSecurity --securityProvider github
```

**Option 2: Personal Access Token**

If you don't have the GitHub CLI, you can provide a GitHub token:

1. Create a personal access token at https://github.com/settings/tokens with `repo` scope
2. Set the token as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
3. Or pass it via CLI:
   ```bash
   pastoralist --checkSecurity --securityProvider github --securityProviderToken your_token_here
   ```

#### Benefits

- Uses GitHub's official Dependabot alerts
- Integrates with your existing GitHub security settings
- No additional API rate limits beyond GitHub's standard limits
- Can be used in GitHub Actions without additional configuration

### Planned Providers

Support for additional providers is planned for future releases:

- **Snyk**: Commercial vulnerability database
- **NPM**: Native npm audit data
- **Socket**: Supply chain security analysis

## How It Works

1. **Scanning**: Pastoralist extracts all dependencies from your `package.json` (and optionally workspace packages)
2. **Checking**: Dependencies are checked against the OSV database for known vulnerabilities
3. **Reporting**: Vulnerable packages are displayed with severity levels and available fixes
4. **Fixing**: If fixes are available, Pastoralist can:
   - Display them for review
   - Apply them automatically (with `--forceSecurityRefactor`)
   - Let you choose interactively (with `--interactive`)
5. **Applying**: Selected fixes are added to your `package.json` overrides section

## Example Output

```

📝 Generated 2 override(s):

  "lodash": "4.17.21" // Security fix: Prototype Pollution (high)
  "minimist": "1.2.6" // Security fix: Prototype Pollution (medium)
```

## Performance Considerations

:::caution[Performance Impact]
- Security scanning is **disabled by default** to maintain fast performance
- Workspace scanning is **opt-in** via the `includeWorkspaces` option
- The OSV provider is optimized for batch queries
- Results are processed in parallel when possible
:::

## Best Practices

- **Regular Scanning**: Run security checks as part of your CI/CD pipeline
- **Review First**: Always review suggested fixes before applying them
- **Test After Fixes**: Ensure your application still works after applying security overrides
- **Monitor Workspaces**: In monorepos, consider enabling workspace scanning for comprehensive coverage

## Limitations

:::note[Current Limitations]
- Currently only supports npm packages
- Only the OSV provider is implemented
- Interactive mode requires the `inquirer` package (installed on demand)
- Some vulnerabilities may not have available fixes
:::

## Troubleshooting

### No vulnerabilities found when expected
- Ensure you're using the latest version of pastoralist
- Check that your dependencies are correctly specified in package.json
- Try running with `--debug` to see detailed logs

### Fixes not being applied
- Verify you have write permissions to package.json
- Check for existing overrides that might conflict
- Ensure the package manager supports overrides

### Performance issues
- Disable workspace scanning if not needed
- Consider excluding large dependency trees with `excludePackages`
- Use severity threshold to limit results

## Example: CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Security Check
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npx pastoralist --checkSecurity
```

### GitLab CI

```yaml
security:
  script:
    - npm install
    - npx pastoralist --checkSecurity
  only:
    - main
    - merge_requests
```
