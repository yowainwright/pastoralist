## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is pastoralist?

Pastoralist is a tool that automatically manages your npm overrides (or yarn resolutions) by creating an appendix that documents why each override exists and which packages depend on them.

### Why do I need pastoralist?

Without pastoralist, it's easy to:
- Forget why an override was added
- Leave outdated overrides in your package.json
- Not know which packages need specific overrides
- Accumulate technical debt over time

### Does pastoralist work with yarn/pnpm?

Pastoralist uses npm's `overrides` format. If you're using:
- **Yarn 1.x**: Convert `resolutions` to `overrides`
- **pnpm**: Convert `pnpm.overrides` to `overrides`
- **Yarn Berry**: Use `resolutions` but consider converting

### Is pastoralist safe to use?

Yes! Pastoralist:
- Only modifies the `overrides` and `pastoralist` sections of package.json
- Preserves all formatting and other fields
- Creates backups in version control (through git)
- Can be rolled back by removing the `pastoralist` section

### When should overrides be used?

Use overrides for:
- Security patches before upstream updates
- Compatibility issues between packages
- Bug fixes not yet released
- Temporary workarounds

## Common Issues

### Overrides Not Being Removed

**Problem:** Pastoralist isn't removing overrides that seem unnecessary.

**Solution:** The override might still be needed by a transitive dependency. Run with debug mode to see why:

```bash
npx pastoralist --debug
```

Look for output showing which packages require the override.

### Package.json Formatting Changes

**Problem:** Pastoralist changes the formatting of my package.json.

**Solution:** Pastoralist preserves formatting as much as possible. If you see changes:
1. Ensure you're using the latest version
2. Check if you have a `.prettierrc` or `.editorconfig` that might conflict
3. Consider running a formatter after pastoralist

### Patches Not Detected

**Problem:** My patch files aren't being tracked in the appendix.

**Solution:** Ensure patches follow the standard naming convention:
```
patches/
├── package-name+1.0.0.patch    # Correct
├── package-name@1.0.0.patch    # Incorrect
└── custom-patch.patch          # Won't be detected
```

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Pastoralist takes a long time to run.

**Solution:** For large monorepos:
1. Run on specific packages instead of all at once
2. Use `--ignore` to skip unnecessary directories
3. Run packages in parallel:

```bash
# Instead of
pastoralist --depPaths "**/*package.json"

# Try
find . -name "package.json" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" | \
  xargs -P 4 -I {} npx pastoralist --path {}
```

### Monorepo Override Conflicts

**Problem:** Different packages in my monorepo need different versions.

**Solution:** Use package-specific overrides:
```json
// root package.json - security patches only
{
  "overrides": {
    "minimist": "1.2.8"
  }
}

// packages/legacy-app/package.json - specific needs
{
  "overrides": {
    "react": "17.0.2"
  }
}
```

### CI Failures

**Problem:** CI fails saying package.json was modified.

**Solution:** Run pastoralist locally and commit the changes:
```bash
npx pastoralist
git add package.json
git commit -m "Update override appendix"
```

Then add to your CI check:
```yaml
- run: npx pastoralist
- run: git diff --exit-code package.json
```

## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed information:

```bash
npx pastoralist --debug
```

Debug output includes:
- Package resolution paths
- Dependency tree analysis
- Override usage detection
- File operation details

## Error Messages

### "Cannot find package.json"

Pastoralist can't locate your package.json. Solutions:
- Run from project root
- Use `--path` to specify location
- Check file permissions

### "Invalid package.json"

Your package.json has syntax errors. Validate with:
```bash
npx json package.json
```

### "No overrides found"

This is normal if you don't have any overrides. Pastoralist will:
- Clean up any existing appendix
- Exit successfully

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Updates

Run pastoralist regularly:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "pastoralist"
  }
}
```

### 2. Document Override Reasons

While pastoralist tracks what depends on overrides, consider adding comments:
```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "lodash": "4.17.21",  // CVE-2021-12345 fix
    "react": "17.0.2"     // Legacy app compatibility
  }
}
```

### 3. Review Periodically

Set reminders to review overrides:
- Check if security patches are merged upstream
- Test if compatibility issues are resolved
- Remove overrides as soon as possible

### 4. Monitor Patch Files

When you see this warning:
```
🐑 Found potentially unused patch files:
  - patches/old-package+1.0.0.patch
```

Review and remove unused patches to keep your repo clean.

- [Discussions](https://github.com/yowainwright/pastoralist/discussions) - Ask questions
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pastoralist) - Community help

### Before Filing an Issue

1. Update to the latest version
2. Run with `--debug` flag
3. Check existing issues
4. Provide minimal reproduction

### Issue Template

When reporting issues, include:
- Pastoralist version
- Node.js version
- Package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm)
- Relevant package.json sections
- Debug output

## Migration Help

### From Manual Management

If you're tracking overrides manually (in comments or docs), pastoralist will:
1. Automatically document all current overrides
2. Track their usage going forward
3. Clean up when no longer needed

### From Other Tools

Moving from other override management tools:
1. Convert to npm `overrides` format
2. Run `npx pastoralist`
3. Remove old tool configuration

## Advanced Debugging

### Trace Dependency Paths

To understand why an override is needed:

```javascript
// debug-override.js
import { update } from 'pastoralist';

await update({
  debug: true,
  path: './package.json'
});

// Check the debug output for dependency paths
```

### Analyze Appendix

```javascript
// analyze-appendix.js
import fs from 'fs';

const pkg = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./package.json', 'utf-8'));
const appendix = pkg.pastoralist?.appendix || {};

console.log('Override Report:');
Object.entries(appendix).forEach(([override, info]) => {
  console.log(`\n${override}:`);
  console.log('  Dependents:', Object.keys(info.dependents || {}));
  console.log('  Patches:', info.patches || 'none');
});
```
