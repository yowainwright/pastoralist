## Nested Overrides (Transitive Dependencies)

Pastoralist supports npm's nested override syntax for overriding transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies).

### How It Works

When you need to override a transitive dependency, you can use nested overrides:

\`\`\`json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "pg": "^8.13.1"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "pg": {
      "pg-types": "^4.0.1"
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

This tells npm to use \`pg-types@^4.0.1\` whenever it's required by the \`pg\` package, regardless of what version \`pg\` actually specifies.

### Multiple Nested Overrides

You can override multiple transitive dependencies:

\`\`\`json
{
  "overrides": {
    "pg": {
      "pg-types": "^4.0.1",
      "pg-protocol": "^1.6.0"
    },
    "express": {
      "cookie": "0.5.0"
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Tracking in Appendix

Nested overrides are tracked with a special notation in the appendix. Each entry
still gets a \`ledger\` recording when it was added:

\`\`\`json
{
  "pastoralist": {
    "appendix": {
      "pg-types@^4.0.1": {
        "dependents": {
          "my-app": "pg@^8.13.1 (nested override)"
        },
        "ledger": {
          "addedDate": "2026-05-30T00:00:00.000Z",
          "source": "manual"
        }
      },
      "cookie@0.5.0": {
        "dependents": {
          "my-app": "express@^4.18.0 (nested override)"
        },
        "ledger": {
          "addedDate": "2026-05-30T00:00:00.000Z",
          "source": "manual"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Workspace Support

In monorepos, nested overrides in workspace packages are also tracked. For example,
\`packages/app/package.json\` might contain:

\`\`\`json
{
  "overrides": {
    "pg": {
      "pg-types": "^4.0.1"
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

Pastoralist will detect and manage these nested overrides across all workspace packages when using the \`--depPaths\` option.

## Patch Support

Pastoralist automatically detects and tracks patches created by tools like \`patch-package\`.

### How It Works

When you have patches in your \`patches/\` directory:

\`\`\`
patches/
├── lodash+4.17.21.patch
├── express+4.18.0.patch
└── react+18.2.0.patch
\`\`\`

Pastoralist will track them in the appendix:

\`\`\`json
{
  "pastoralist": {
    "appendix": {
      "lodash@4.17.21": {
        "dependents": {
          "my-app": "lodash@^4.17.0"
        },
        "patches": ["patches/lodash+4.17.21.patch"],
        "ledger": {
          "addedDate": "2026-05-30T00:00:00.000Z",
          "source": "manual"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Unused Patch Detection

When a dependency is removed, pastoralist alerts you:

\`\`\`
🐑 Found 2 potentially unused patch files:
  - patches/old-package+1.0.0.patch
  - patches/removed-dep+2.0.0.patch
Consider removing these patches if the packages are no longer used.
\`\`\`

</a>

## PeerDependencies Support

Pastoralist considers \`peerDependencies\` when tracking override usage.

### Example

\`\`\`json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "react": "18.2.0"
  }
}
\`\`\`

The appendix will reflect peer dependency requirements:

\`\`\`json
{
  "pastoralist": {
    "appendix": {
      "react@18.2.0": {
        "dependents": {
          "my-component": "react@^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0"
        },
        "ledger": {
          "addedDate": "2026-05-30T00:00:00.000Z",
          "source": "manual"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Smart Cleanup

Pastoralist identifies overrides that are no longer needed and can remove them
when you explicitly opt in.

### Removal with \`--remove-unused\`

When a dependency is updated and no longer needs an override:

**Before:**

\`\`\`json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.0"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "lodash": "4.17.21"
  }
}
\`\`\`

**After updating lodash to 4.17.21 and running \`pastoralist --remove-unused\`:**

\`\`\`json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  },
  "overrides": {}
}
\`\`\`

<a
  href="https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/yowainwright/pastoralist/tree/main/tests/sandboxes/cleanup?title=Pastoralist%20Cleanup&file=README.md&startScript=demo&view=editor"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
  <img src="https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg" alt="Open in StackBlitz" />
</a>

### Unused Override Detection

When an override exists but no package in your project depends on it, Pastoralist labels it as \`(unused override)\` in the appendix:

\`\`\`json
{
  "pastoralist": {
    "appendix": {
      "stale-pkg@1.0.0": {
        "dependents": {
          "root": "stale-pkg (unused override)"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

Pastoralist displays a notice when unused overrides are detected:

\`\`\`
|  1 unused override detected. Run with --remove-unused to clean up.  |
\`\`\`

To remove them, run with the \`--remove-unused\` flag:

\`\`\`bash
pastoralist --remove-unused
\`\`\`

This removes both the override from \`overrides\` and its entry from the appendix.

### Protecting Overrides from Removal

Set \`keep: true\` on a ledger entry to prevent \`--remove-unused\` from ever removing it:

\`\`\`json
{
  "lodash@4.17.21": {
    "ledger": {
      "addedDate": "2026-05-30T00:00:00.000Z",
      "keep": true
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

For time- or version-bounded protection, use a \`KeepConstraint\`:

\`\`\`json
{
  "lodash@4.17.21": {
    "ledger": {
      "addedDate": "2026-05-30T00:00:00.000Z",
      "keep": {
        "reason": "Waiting for upstream patch",
        "untilVersion": "4.18.0",
        "until": "2027-06-01"
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

Once the condition is met, \`--remove-unused\` can treat the override as removable
again.

### Transitive Dependency Tracking

Pastoralist tracks overrides needed by transitive dependencies:

\`\`\`json
{
  "pastoralist": {
    "appendix": {
      "minimist@1.2.8": {
        "dependents": {
          "mkdirp": "minimist@^1.2.6",
          "optimist": "minimist@~1.2.0"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Fuzzy Version Matching

Pastoralist uses version-range matching to determine if overrides are needed.

### How It Works

Given these dependencies:

\`\`\`json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0"
  }
}
\`\`\`

And this override:

\`\`\`json
{
  "overrides": {
    "express": "4.18.2"
  }
}
\`\`\`

Pastoralist understands that \`^4.18.0\` could resolve to \`4.18.2\` naturally, so the override might not be necessary unless it's fixing a specific issue.

## Appendix Cleanup

Pastoralist keeps appendix entries while an override is still tracked. When you
run with \`--remove-unused\`, it removes both the override and the matching
appendix entry.

### Example Scenario

1. **Initial state**: Override with appendix
2. **Dependency removed**: Pastoralist reports the override as unused
3. **Cleanup run**: \`--remove-unused\` removes the override and appendix entry

Use ledger \`reason\` and \`keep\` fields for override decisions that should stay
reviewable until a specific cleanup condition is met.

## Multi-Format Support

Pastoralist reads the override field your package manager already uses:

- **npm and Bun**: \`overrides\`
- **pnpm**: \`pnpm.overrides\`
- **Yarn**: \`resolutions\`

When it writes changes, it preserves the existing override field when one is
present. If a security fix creates the first override field in a project,
Pastoralist chooses the field that matches the detected package manager.

### Format Example

Yarn resolutions:

\`\`\`json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "package-a": "1.0.0",
    "**/package-b": "2.0.0"
  }
}
\`\`\`

The equivalent npm or Bun override shape:

\`\`\`json
{
  "overrides": {
    "package-a": "1.0.0",
    "package-b": "2.0.0"
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Debug Mode Insights

Debug mode (\`--debug\`) provides detailed information:

\`\`\`
🐑 pastoralist checking herd...
[DEBUG] Reading package.json from /path/to/package.json
[DEBUG] Found 3 overrides
[DEBUG] Analyzing dependency tree...
[DEBUG] lodash@4.17.21 required by:
  - express@4.18.0 (wants lodash@^4.17.0)
  - custom-utils@1.0.0 (wants lodash@~4.17.0)
[DEBUG] Writing updated package.json
✅ pastoralist the herd is safe!
\`\`\`

## Integration with Other Tools

### patch-package

Pastoralist complements \`patch-package\` by tracking which overrides have associated patches:

\`\`\`bash
# Apply a patch
npx patch-package lodash

# Run pastoralist to update tracking
npx pastoralist
\`\`\`

### npm-check-updates

Use with \`npm-check-updates\` to manage both regular updates and overrides:

\`\`\`bash
# Update dependencies
npx npm-check-updates -u

# Update override tracking
npx pastoralist
\`\`\`

### Renovate/Dependabot

Configure automated tools to run pastoralist after updates:

\`\`\`json
{
  "postUpgradeTasks": {
    "commands": ["npm install", "npx pastoralist"],
    "fileFilters": ["package.json"]
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Custom Workflows

### Override Policies

Create policies for when overrides should be used:

\`\`\`javascript
// scripts/check-override-policy.js
const pkg = require("./package.json");

const policies = {
  security: ["minimist", "lodash"], // Require review before keeping security overrides
  compatibility: ["react"], // Track compatibility overrides
  temporary: ["experimental-pkg"], // Review temporary overrides regularly
};

// Validate overrides match policies
Object.keys(pkg.overrides || {}).forEach((override) => {
  const category = Object.entries(policies).find(([_, pkgs]) => pkgs.includes(override))?.[0];

  if (!category) {
    console.warn(\`Override '\${override}' has no policy!\`);
  }
});
\`\`\`

### Appendix Analysis

Extract insights from the appendix:

\`\`\`javascript
const pkg = require("./package.json");
const appendix = pkg.pastoralist?.appendix || {};

// Find overrides with most dependents
const overrideImpact = Object.entries(appendix)
  .map(([override, info]) => ({
    override,
    dependentCount: Object.keys(info.dependents || {}).length,
  }))
  .sort((a, b) => b.dependentCount - a.dependentCount);

console.log("Highest impact overrides:", overrideImpact.slice(0, 5));
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Run pastoralist on install, scheduled CI, or dependency-update PRs
2. **Review Patches**: Check for upstream fixes when dependencies update
`;export{e as default};
