This demo shows how to migrate existing overrides to pastoralist:

ðŸ“‹ Current Situation:
   - Multiple overrides added over time
   - No documentation about why they exist
   - Some might be outdated or unnecessary
   - Team doesn't know which are safe to remove

ðŸŽ¯ Migration Goals:
   - Document all existing overrides
   - Identify which packages need them
   - Remove unnecessary overrides
   - Add security scanning
   - Maintain automatically going forward

ðŸ“¦ Existing Overrides (undocumented):
   - lodash: 4.17.21
   - minimist: 1.2.6
   - glob-parent: 6.0.2
   - trim-newlines: 3.0.1
   - node-fetch: 2.6.7

ðŸš€ Commands to try:
   bun run before   - Show current messy state
   bun run migrate  - Run pastoralist migration
   bun run after    - Show cleaned, documented state

ðŸ’¡ After migration:
   - Each override has documentation
   - Unnecessary overrides are removed
   - Team knows why each override exists
   - Future maintenance is automated
