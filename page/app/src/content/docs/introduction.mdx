## What is Pastoralist?

Pastoralist is a command-line tool that automatically manages and updates your package.json overrides, resolutions, and patches. It ensures that your dependency overrides stay up-to-date with the latest versions, saving you time and reducing potential security vulnerabilities.

## Why is Pastoralist Awesome?

### The Problem

When working with Node.js projects, you often need to override specific package versions due to:
- Security vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies
- Bug fixes that haven't been merged upstream
- Breaking changes you need to avoid
- Custom patches for specific use cases

However, managing these overrides manually is tedious and error-prone:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "lodash": "4.17.19",
    "minimist": "1.2.5",
    "node-fetch": "2.6.7"
  }
}
```

Over time, these overrides become outdated, and you might miss important security updates or bug fixes.

### The Solution

Pastoralist automates this process by:
- Scanning your package.json for overrides, resolutions, and patches
- Checking for newer versions of overridden packages
- Updating them automatically while maintaining compatibility
- Removing overrides that are no longer needed

With one simple command, you can ensure all your overrides are current:

```bash
pastoralist
```

## How Pastoralist Works

<ReviewFlow />

Pastoralist manages overrides, resolutions, and patches so you don't have to!

It is comprised of a few functions which read the root package.json file's overrides or resolutions and map the packages in them to a `pastoralist.appendix` object. Additionally, it automatically detects and tracks patches in your project (such as those created by `patch-package`).

If Pastoralist observes an override, resolution, or patch is no longer needed, it removes it from the respective objects and the pastoralist appendix object, and notifies you about unused patches.

This means with Pastoralist, your only concern is adding dependencies to the overrides and resolutions objects - patch tracking happens automatically.

### Workspace Support

In workspace/monorepo setups, Pastoralist:
- Reads the root package.json or project manifest file
- Maps all overrides, resolutions, and patches to the `pastoralist.appendix` object
- Updates dependencies across all workspaces
- Maintains consistency throughout your monorepo

## What Are Overrides, Resolutions, and Patches?

### Overrides (npm)

Overrides allow you to replace a package version in your dependency tree with a different version. This is npm's way of handling dependency conflicts:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "foo": "1.0.0",
    "bar": {
      "baz": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Resolutions (Yarn)

Resolutions serve the same purpose for Yarn users, allowing you to force specific versions:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "foo": "1.0.0",
    "**/bar/baz": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Patches

Patches are custom modifications to node_modules packages, typically created with tools like `patch-package`. Pastoralist automatically detects and tracks these patches.

## Object Anatomy

The Pastoralist object in your package.json provides full transparency into what's being managed:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "minimist": "1.2.8"
  },
  "pastoralist": {
    "appendix": {
      "minimist": {
        "key": "minimist",
        "version": "1.2.8",
        "parentKeys": [".", "mkdirp"],
        "hasOverride": true,
        "hasResolution": false,
        "hasPatch": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Appendix Properties

- **key**: The package name
- **version**: Current override version
- **parentKeys**: Where this dependency appears in your tree
- **hasOverride**: Whether an npm override exists
- **hasResolution**: Whether a Yarn resolution exists
- **hasPatch**: Whether a patch file exists

## Getting Started

1. Install Pastoralist globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pastoralist
   ```

2. Run it in your project:
   ```bash
   pastoralist
   ```

3. That's it! Pastoralist will automatically:
   - Scan for overrides and resolutions
   - Check for updates
   - Update your package.json
   - Track everything in the appendix
