## How Pastoralist works

Pastoralist manages overrides, resolutions, and patches so you don't have to!

It is comprised of a few functions which read the root package.json file's overrides or resolutions and map the packages in them to a `pastoralist.appendix` object. Additionally, it automatically detects and tracks patches in your project (such as those created by `patch-package`).

If Pastoralist observes an override, resolution, or patch is no longer needed, it removes it from the respective objects and the pastoralist appendix object, and notifies you about unused patches.

This means with Pastoralist, your only concern is adding dependencies to the overrides and resolutions objects - patch tracking happens automatically.
Broken down, Pastoralist manages your overrides, resolutions, and patches with 4 simple steps demonstrated in the flow chart below.

### Key notes

1. Pastoralist does **not** manage what is added to overrides or resolutions objects.
2. Pastoralist **does** manage dependencies that exist in a `package.json`'s overrides or resolutions objects.
3. Pastoralist **automatically detects and tracks patches** in your project without any configuration.
4. Pastoralist **supports all dependency types**: `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies`.
5. Pastoralist will remove overrides and resolutions if they become unneeded according to child package.json's spec!
6. Pastoralist will **notify you about unused patches** when packages are no longer in your dependencies.

### Workspaces and Monorepos

Pastoralist works seamlessly with workspace/monorepo setups. Here's how:

1. **Per-Package Operation**: Pastoralist operates on a single `package.json` at a time. Use the `--path` flag to target specific workspace packages:
   ```bash
   # Root package.json
   pastoralist
   # Workspace package
   pastoralist --path packages/app-a/package.json
   ```

2. **Cross-Package Analysis**: When running in a workspace:
   - Examines direct dependencies of the target package
   - Checks dependencies of workspace siblings
   - Verifies override necessity against the entire workspace tree

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Use root-level overrides for shared dependencies
   - Use workspace-level overrides for package-specific issues
   - Store patches centrally (e.g., root `/patches` directory)

4. **Automation**: Consider adding to workspace scripts:
   ```js
   {
     "scripts": {
       "update-overrides": "pastoralist && pastoralist --path packages/app-a/package.json"
     }
   }
   ```
