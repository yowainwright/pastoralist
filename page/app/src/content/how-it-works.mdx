## How Pastoralist works

Pastoralist manages overrides and resolutions so you don't have to!

It is comprised of a few functions which read the root package.json file's overrides or resolutions and map the packages in them to a `pastoralist.appendix` object.

If Pastoralist observes an override or resolution is no longer needed, it removes it from resolutions or overrides, and the pastoralist appendix object.

This means with Pastoralist, your only concern is adding dependencies to the overrides and resolutions objects.
Broken down, Pastoralist manages your overrides and resolutions with 4 simple steps demonstrated in the flow chart below.

### Key notes

1. Pastoralist does **not** manage what is added to overrides or resolutions objects.
2. Pastoralist **does** manage dependenceis that exists in a `package.json`'s overrides or resolutions objects.
3. Pastoralist will remove overrides and resolutions if they become unneeded according to child package.json's spec!
