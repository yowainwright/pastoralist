## How Pastoralist works

**Pastoralist** manages `overrides` and `resolutions` so you don't have to!

**Pastoralist** is comprised of a few functions which read **node_modules** `package.json` files and reduce overrides or resolutions within the root `package.json` into a single `pastoralist.appendix` object.

- **Pastoralist** adds an `pastoralist.appendix` with a list of "resolved" dependencies.
- Better yet, if Pastoralist observes an `override` or `resolution` is no longer needed, it removes it from `resolutions`, `overrides`, and the pastoralist `appendix` object.
- This means with **Pastoralist**, your **only** concern is adding dependencies to the `overrides` and `resolutions` objects.

### Key notes

- **Pastoralist** does **not** manage what is added to overrides and resolutions objects.
- **Pastoralist does** manage dependenceis that exists in a `package.json`'s overrides or resolutions objects.
  - **Pastoralist** will remove overrides and resolutions if they become unneeded according to child `package.json`'s spec!
