#### *Overrides and resolutions

Overrides and resolutions solve the same problem—they give developers a way to specify the dependency versions downloaded to repository's node_modules. This is very convenient for specifying specific node_module versions and fixing security issues.

However, it is easy to lose track of why an override or resolution is specified. This is an inconvenient problem when trying to maintain dependencies over time—until now!
