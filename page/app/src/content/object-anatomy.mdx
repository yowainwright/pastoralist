### Pastoralist Object Anatomy

When **Pastoralist** is run in a respository with override or resolution dependencies, it will output a shape like below.

```js
// package.json
"pastoralist": {
  // the appendix contains mapped resolutions/overrides
  "appendix": {
    // the resolution/override is stringified with it's version
    "trim@^0.0.3": {
      // dependents contain dependents which actually require the override/resolution dependency
      "dependenents": {
        "remark-parse": "4.0.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When ever **Pastoralist** is run again, it will check the `pastoralist.appendix` object and remove any resolutions/overrides that are no longer needed.
