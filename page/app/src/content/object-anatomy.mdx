### Pastoralist Object Anatomy

When **Pastoralist** is run in a repository with override, resolution dependencies, or patches, it will output a shape like below.

```js
// package.json
"pastoralist": {
  // the appendix contains mapped resolutions/overrides and patches
  "appendix": {
    // the resolution/override is stringified with its version
    "trim@^0.0.3": {
      // dependents contain dependents which actually require the override/resolution dependency
      "dependents": {
        "remark-parse": "4.0.0"
      }
    },
    "lodash@4.17.21": {
      "dependents": {
        "my-app": "lodash@^4.17.0"
      },
      // patches array shows which patch files are applied to this package
      "patches": ["patches/lodash+4.17.21.patch"]
    }
  }
}
```

Whenever **Pastoralist** is run again, it will check the `pastoralist.appendix` object and remove any resolutions/overrides that are no longer needed, and notify you about unused patches.
