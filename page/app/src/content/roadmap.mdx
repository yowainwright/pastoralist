## Roadmap

**Updated `2022-08-06`**

- More tests (in progress)
- Provide more configuration options using a tool like [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig)
- Provide caveats, code examples, and more documentation
- **Note:** the shape of the `pastoralist` object may change rapidly currently to improve the API.
  - **However, Pastoralist** is built to work on it's own so, generally, you shouldn't worry about it!
