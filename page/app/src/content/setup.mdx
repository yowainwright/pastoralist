## Setup

Okay! Hopefully the breakdowns above were clear enough on why you might want to use Pastoralist!
Please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/yowainwright/pastoralist/pulls) or [issue](https://github.com/yowainwright/pastoralist/issues) if it wasn't!

Now for the super simple setup!

1. Install

```bash
npm install pastoralist --save-dev
# pastoralist does not expect to be a dependency! It's a tool!!!
```

2. run

```bash
pastoralist
# => That's it! Check out your package.json
```

3. (recommended) add Pastoralist to a postInstall script

```js
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "pastoralist"
  }
}
```

In the near feature, Pastoralist will fully support a config file but this is it for now!

Read on to understand what is going on under the hood of Pastoralist!
