## Why is Patoralist Awesome?

It is easy to lose track of _why_ a dependency is in an `overrides` or `resolutions` object.
This is an inconvenient problem when trying to maintain dependencies over time. _Until now!_

After installing Pastoralist, by running:

```sh
pastoralist
```

as a CLI command, an override/resolution which looks like this:

```js
// package.json
"overrides": {
  "trim": "^0.0.3"
},
```

Will look like this:

```js
// package.json
"overrides": {
  "trim": "^0.0.3"
},
"pastoralist": {
  "appendix": {
    "trim@^0.0.3": {
      "dependenents": {
        "remark-parse": "4.0.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

But there's more!

If **Pastoralist** is run and a `resolution` or `override` is no longer required it will clean up itself and resolutions! AKA, the object above, will now look like the object below if `trim` is no longer needed.

```js
"overrides": {},
"pastoralist": {
  "appendix": {}
}
```
