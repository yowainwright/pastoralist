## Synopsis

By running **Pastoralist** in a `pre-commit` hook or other command an override/resolution which looks like this:

```js
// package.json
"overrides": {
  "trim": "^0.0.3"
},
```

Will look like this:

```js
// package.json
"overrides": {
  "trim": "^0.0.3"
},
"pastoralist": {
  "appendix": {
    "trim@^0.0.3": {
      "dependenents": {
        "remark-parse": "4.0.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

By running this!

```bash
pastoralist
# oh hech yeah!
```

But there's more!

If **Pastoralist** is run and a `resolution` or `override` is no longer required
it will clean up itself and resolutions!

```js
// pastoralist finds and removes `trim` when/if it's no longer needed!
"overrides": {},
"pastoralist": {
  "appendix": {}
}
```
