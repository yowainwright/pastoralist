## What _are_ \*overrides, resolutions, and patches?

> Overrides and resolutions solve the same problem.<br />
> They give developers a way to specify dependency versions downloaded to repository's node_modules folder.

Node package manager CLIs, like npm, yarn, and pnpm, enable engineers to solve dependency specificity issues by adding an overrides or resolutions object to a repository's root package.json. This is awesome for fixing dependency issues with security and/or code. Read more about [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#resolutions), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides) overrides or resolution solutions.

> **Patches** take this a step further by allowing you to modify package source code directly.

Tools like `patch-package` let you create patches that modify installed packages. Pastoralist automatically detects these patches and tracks them alongside your overrides and resolutions, helping you keep track of which packages have been modified and alerting you to unused patches when packages are removed.

### Minimal Patch Details

Pastoralist seamlessly integrates patch management alongside overrides and resolutions, automatically detecting and tracking patches in common configurations. This aids in maintaining and removing patches efficiently.
