## What _are_ \*overrides and resolutions?

> Overrides and resolutions solve the same problem.<br />
> They give developers a way to specify dependency versions downloaded to repository's node_modules folder.

Node package manager CLIs, like npm, yarn, and pnpm, enable engineers to solve dependency specificity issues by adding an overrides or resolutions object to a repository's root package.json. This is awesome for fixing dependency issues with security and/or code. Read more about [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#resolutions), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides) overrides or resolution solutions.
