## Why is Pastoralist Awesome?

It is easy to lose track of _why_ a dependency is in an overrides or resolutions object in a repository's root `package.json`.
This is an inconvenient problem when trying to maintain dependencies over time. _Until now!_

By installing the Pastoralist CLI and running:

```sh
pastoralist
```

an overrides (resolution) object that looks like this:

```js
// package.json
"overrides": {
  "trim": "^0.0.3"
},
```

Will look like this:

```js
// package.json
"overrides": {
  "trim": "^0.0.3"
},
"pastoralist": {
  "appendix": {
    "trim@^0.0.3": {
      "dependenents": {
        "remark-parse": "4.0.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

But there's more!

If Pastoralist is run and an override or resolution is no longer required, Pastoralist will remove the dependency from `pastoralist.appendix` and overrides!

AKA, the object above, will now look like the object below if trim is no longer needed.

```js
"overrides": {},
"pastoralist": {
  "appendix": {}
}
```
